Future Budgets will over tim e, as these principles b ecome m ore firm ly integrated with decision making processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles. The Budget is economically sustainable. The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four years. Short and long-term financial indi cators are sound. Cash reserves are reducing through to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general governm ent borrowings have not increased. The Budget is socially responsible. Considerab le resources are directed into key service delivery areas, such as health, education, child and fam ily support.
